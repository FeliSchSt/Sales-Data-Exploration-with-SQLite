# Sales-Data-Exploration-with-SQLite

This exercise serves to showcase my skills in SQL language.

In the SQLite script I explore a Kaggle dataset on sales, uploaded as Kaggle_sales.csv. The dataset containts 1000 entries with the columns Date mostly 2023, except for two entries in 2024), CustomerID, Gender, Age, ProductCategory, PriceperUnit and TotalAmount. I wrote code that helps answering the following questions: 

- How does customer age and gender influence their purchasing behaviour?
- Are there discernible patterns in sales over the year 2023?
- Which product categories hold the highest appeal among customers?
- What are the relationships between age, spending, and product preferences?
- How do customers adapt their shopping habits during seasonal trends?
- Are there distinct purchasing behaviors based on the number of items bought per transaction?
- What insights can be gleaned from the distribution of product prices within each category?
